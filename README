To ensure that JNI programs work on macOS, ensure that your installed JDK declares the
"BundledApp" and "JNI" capabilities in the Info.plist file for the installed JDK.

For example, the latest version for 1.8 is at the time of writing this part of the
README in the following file:

       /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_162.jdk/Contents/Info.plist

Edit the Info.plist file to look as follows:

                <key>JVMCapabilities</key>
                <array>
                        <string>BundledApp</string>
                        <string>CommandLine</string>
                        <string>JNI</string>
                </array>

After this JNI programs should work normally.
